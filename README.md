## lumberjack
A Go package for wrapping the "log" package with some helper functions.  
Basically it's an opinionated logger (see what I did there?).

## Caveat
I'm writing this as yet another Go package that is probably done better
elsewhere.  I'm doing it for practice and my own edification.  I highly
recommend https://github.com/op/go-logging as an alternative as it looks way
more sophisticated and supported.
